# VolleyBall-AI
I recently worked on a 2D Volleyball game and developed a fairly decent AI for it. Here's the source code.

There're 3 scripts
1. Player.cs
2. AIBehaviour.cs
3. BallBehaviour.cs

3 Rigidbodies in the scene for the Player, the ball and the AI bot

The sprites setup is shown in the figure below:
